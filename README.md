## Projects

In this repository I intend to keep track of some algorithms I've been learning throw the past year.
Code consists on a Django application that runs the algorithms, written in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (Processing) as static files.

Explanations about how they work and what they do are also provided.


To run the code you'll have to create a virtual environment with the requirements file.

```
# Create the virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
$ source venv/bin/activate

# Install needed libraries
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project locally
$ python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

```
