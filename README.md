## Projects

In this repository I intend to keep track of some algorithms I've been learning throw the past year.
Code consists on a Django application that runs the algorithms, written in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (Processing) as static files.

Explanations about how they work and what they do are also provided.

All help, ideas and questions are welcomed at ddiazq.2012091 (at) gmail.com
